# OpenGL Demos

This repository contains a compendium of small OpenGL applications built to demonstrate concepts of Computer Graphics. It is used as support material for the Computer Graphics course at the [Federal University of Fronteira Sul](https://www.uffs.edu.br). The demos in this repository were mainly created by [Cesar Tadeu Pozzer](http://www-usr.inf.ufsm.br/~pozzer/) at the [Federal University of Santa Maria](https://www.ufsm.br)

> ***NOTICE: currently this repository contains documentation for Windows users only. If you intend to use Linux, please talk to the course responsible.***

## Getting started

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure that your machine has up-to-date graphic drivers and a development environment is installed, e.g. [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).

### 2. Clone the project

Clone this repository in a folder of your choice, e.g. `c:\`:

```
git clone https://github.com/Dovyski/opengl-demos.git opengl-demos && cd opengl-demos
```
### 3. Open the solution file

Open the solution file named `OpenGL-demos.sln` to load all the demos/projects.

### 4. Build all demos (optional)

If you want to test all demos/projetcs right away, after opening the solution file, go to `Build -> Build Solution` (or press <kbd>F7</kbd>). If nothing goes wrong, you should see several executable files in the folder `build\x64\Debug` (or `build\x64\Release` if you compiled using the release configuration)

## Running and compiling a particular demo

You can compile and run any of the demos/projects individually by right-clicking it in the solution explorer, then selecting `Set as Startup Project`. After that, hit <kbd>F5</kbd> and the project will compile and run.

## License

The code files in this repository have mixed licenses. Please refer to each file/project to check its license.
